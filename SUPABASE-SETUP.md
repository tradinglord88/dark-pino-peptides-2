## Test Your Setup

After running the SQL script, test these features:

- You should see 6 subscription plans
- Try clicking "Start Subscription" (requires login)

### 3. User Dashboard

## Database Tables Created

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `users` | User profiles extending auth.users |
| `orders` | Customer orders |
| `order_items` | Products in each order |
| `shipping_addresses` | Delivery addresses |
| `subscription_plans` | Available subscription tiers |
| `user_subscriptions` | Active user subscriptions |
| `subscription_items` | Products in subscriptions |
| `subscription_deliveries` | Shipment tracking |
| `subscription_delivery_items` | Items per delivery |
| `subscription_preferences` | User preferences |

## Default Subscription Plans

The setup creates 6 subscription plans:

### Monthly Plans
1. **Starter Monthly** - $79.99/month (1 peptide, 10% discount)
2. **Pro Monthly** - $149.99/month (2 peptides, 15% discount) 
3. **Elite Monthly** - $199.99/month (3 peptides, 20% discount)

### Quarterly Plans
1. **Starter Quarterly** - $199.99/quarter (3 peptides total, 20% discount)
2. **Pro Quarterly** - $379.99/quarter (6 peptides total, 25% discount)
3. **Elite Quarterly** - $499.99/quarter (9 peptides total, 30% discount)

## Troubleshooting

### If you get permission errors:
1. Make sure you're logged into the correct Supabase project
2. Verify you have admin access to the project
3. Try running the script in smaller sections

### If authentication isn't working:
1. Check that your development server restarted
2. Verify the environment variables are correct
3. Clear your browser cache and try again

### If subscription plans don't show:
1. Make sure the SQL script completed successfully
2. Check the `subscription_plans` table has data
3. Verify RLS policies are properly set

## Next Steps

Once your database is set up:

1. **Test user registration** - Create a test account
2. **Try subscriptions** - Test the subscription flow
3. **Check order tracking** - Verify the account dashboard works
4. **Test all payment methods** - Stripe, Solana Pay, E-Transfer

Your Dark Pino Peptides website now has a complete user authentication and subscription system! üöÄ
